# Systems Shared Schema

The shared schemas directory holds all OpenAPI definitions for all the microservices. Ideally, these schemas would be used for swagger documentation in addition to:
 - (1) auto-generate the GraphQL schema
 - (2) auto-generate the Typescript types
 - (3) Prisma entity types

## Schemas

- tx-customers
- tx-orders
- tx-inventories
- tx-stores
